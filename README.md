# 2017

Lets see, how much values we coukd make from 4 digits: 2017

Numbers should be in same order (2 0 1 7). You could add any number of algebra symbols (that are not characters) to equations. Numbers and letters are not allowed. Constans like π are not allowed.

Example of allowed symbols: -*^!(

Different combinations for same value, will be separated by semicolon. Spaces are optional.

Pull requests are higly welcome!
